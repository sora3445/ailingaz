come true it's called Cinderella once

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.220
upon a time there was a gentleman who

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
married for his second wife the proudest

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.190
and most haughty woman there ever was

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.770
she had been married before and already

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.830
had two daughters who were exactly like

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.360
her in all things he had likewise by his

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.980
first wife a young daughter but of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.020
unequaled goodness and sweetness of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.270
temper which she took from her mother

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.380
who was the best creature in the world

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.959
this sweet little girl missed her mother

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.650
who had died ever so much

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.709
no sooner was the wedding ceremony over

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.620
than the new wife began to show herself

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.090
in her true colors she could not bear

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.340
the goodness of the gentleman's pretty

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.640
girl and especially as she made her own

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
daughter's appear the more horrid she

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.430
made her do the meanest jobs in the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.000
house

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.480
the girls scoured the dishes and tables

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.510
and scrubbed the stepmothers bathroom

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.139
and those of her daughters she slept in

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.530
a little attic upon a wretched straw bed

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.920
while her sisters lay upon beds with the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.879
softest pillows in fine rooms with

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.430
floors covered with beautiful carpets

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
and walls on which hung looking glasses

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.700
so large that they might see themselves

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.609
at their full length from head to foot

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.879
as she was doing this they said to her

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.430
Cinderella would you not be glad to go

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.220
to the ball alas said she

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.480
girl like me to go there you're quite

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.659

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.090
people laugh to see a cinderwench at a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.470
ball anyone but Cinderella would have

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.949
dressed their heads all wrong but she

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.250
was very good and dressed them perfectly

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.470
well the stepsisters were almost two

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.889
days without eating so much were they

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.609
thrilled and excited they broke above a

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.220
dozen corsets in trying to be laced up

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.129
tightly so that they might have a fine

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.430
slender shape and they were continually

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.720
at their looking-glass at last the happy

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.099
day came they went to court and

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.479
Cinderella followed them with her eyes

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.449
as long as she could and when she had

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.950
lost sight of them she fell a crying

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.300
just

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.539
her fairy godmother who used to watch

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.080
over her secretly saw her all in tears

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.229
and appeared at her side and asked her

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.120
what was the matter I wish I could I

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.150
wish I could she was not able to speak

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.849
the rest being interrupted by her tears

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.690
and sobbing this fairy godmother of her

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.490
said to her you wish you could go to the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.039
ball is it not so yes cried Cinderella

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.270
with a great sigh well said her

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.740
godmother be but a good girl and I will

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.120
see that you shall go to the ball then

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.550
she took her into her secret room and

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.849
said to her run into the garden and

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.990
bring me a pumpkin Cinderella went

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.090
immediately to gather the finest she

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.090
could and bought it to her godmother not

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.490
being able to imagine how this pumpkin

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.669
could make her go to the ball her

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.280
godmother scooped out all the inside of

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.560
the big vegetable leaving nothing but

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.770
the rind which done she struck it with

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.949
her wand and the pumpkin was instantly

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.630
turned into a fine coach gilded all over

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.370
with gold she then went to look into her

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.729
mousetrap where she found six mice all

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.389
alive and ordered Cinderella to lift up

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.139
a little the trapdoor as each Mouse went

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.870
out she gave it a little tap with her

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.599
wand and the mouse was that moment

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.930
turned into a fine horse which

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.289
altogether made a very fine set of six

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.380
horses of a beautiful Mouse colored

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.770
dapple gray but they still needed a

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.030
coachman I will go and see says

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.520
Cinderella if there is a wrapt in the

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.169
rat trap we may make a coachman of him

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.779
you're a smart one replied her godmother

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.350
go and look

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.120
Cinderella brought the trap to her and

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.050
in it there were three huge rats the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.120
fairy made choice of one of the three

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.419
which had the largest beard and having

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.970
touched him with her wand he was turned

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.389
into a fat jolly coachman who had the

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.590
smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld after

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.650
that she said to her go again to the

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.400
garden and you will find six lizards

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.169
behind the watering pot bring them to me

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.360
she had no sooner done so but her

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.970
godmother turned them into six footmen

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.610
who skipped up immediately behind the

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.340
couch with their uniforms Alba dogged

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.060
with gold and silver and clung as close

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.400
behind each other as if they had done

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.060
nothing else their whole lives the fairy

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.440
then said to Cinderella wow you have

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.440
here transport fit to take you to the

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.050
ball are you not pleased with it

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.020
oh yes cried she but must I go there as

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.849
I am in these nasty rags her godmother

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:58.700
only just touched her with her wand and

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.300
at the same instant her clothes were

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.240
turned into a cloth of gold and silver

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.770
all beset with jewels this done

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.560
she gave her a pair of glass slippers

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.720
the prettiest in the whole world

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.389
being thus decked out she got up into

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:23.750
her coach but her godmother above all

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.889
things commanded her not to stay till

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.760
after midnight telling her at the same

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.240
time that if she stayed one moment

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.120
longer the coach would be a pumpkin

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.930
again her horses mice her coachman are

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.500
at her footmen lizards and her clothes

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.540
become just as they were before she

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.579
promised her godmother she would not

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:53.390
fail

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.510
leaving the ball before midnight then

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.080
off she went to the ball scarce able to

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.500
contain herself for joy

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.200
the king's son who was told that a great

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.520
princess whom nobody knew was to come

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.160
ran out to receive her he gave her his

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.650
hand as she alighted out of the coach

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.590
and led her into the ball amongst all

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.680
the company there was immediately a

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.760
profound silence the dancing stopped and

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.290
the violins ceased to play so attentive

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.890
was everyone to contemplate the singular

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.060
beauty of the unknown newcomer

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.830
nothing was then heard but a confused

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:47.600
noise of ah-hah how lovely she is ha how

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.660
lovely she is the king himself old as he

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.530
was could not help watching her and

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.690
telling the Queen softly that it was a

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.170
long time since he had seen so beautiful

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.670
and lovely a creature all the ladies

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.070
were busied in considering her clothes

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.980
and headdress that they might have some

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.230
maid the next day after in the same

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.470
pattern provided they could find such

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.010
fine material and as able hands to make

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.380
them the king's son led her to the most

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.600
honourable seat and afterward took her

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.080
out to dance with him she danced so very

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.170
gracefully that they all the more and

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.100
more admired her a fine banquet was

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.800
served up of which the young prince ate

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.670
not a morsel so intently was he busied

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.660
in gazing upon her she went and sat down

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.930
by her sisters showing them a thousand

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.900
polite gestures giving them part of the

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.300
oranges and lemon blossoms which the

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.270
prince had presented her with which very

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.670
much surprised them for they did not

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.010
recognize her

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.950
while Cinderella was thus amusing her

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.160
sisters she heard the clock strike 11

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.540
and 3/4 whereupon she immediately made a

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.090
curtsy to the company and hey stood away

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.570
as fast as she could when she got home

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.350
she ran to seek out her godmother and

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.990
after having thanked her she said she

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.900
could not but heartily wish she might go

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.300
the next day to the ball because the

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.040
king's son had desired her to go as she

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.660
was eagerly telling her godmother

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.390
whatever had passed at the ball her two

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.400
sisters knocked at the door which

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.390
Cinderella ran and opened how long

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.740
you've stayed cried she gaping rubbing

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.650
her eyes and stretching herself as if

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.300
she had been just wait out of her sleep

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.120
if you had been at the ball said one of

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.430
her sisters you would not have been

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.720
tired with it

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.310
they came the finest princess the most

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.670
beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.070
she was a thousand times nice to us and

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.380
gave us oranges and lemon blossoms

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.630
Cinderella seemed a very indifferent in

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.660
the matter indeed she asked them the

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.450
name of that princess but they told her

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.850
they did not know it and that the king's

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.820
son was very uneasy on her account and

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.640
would give all the world to know who she

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.660
was at this Cinderella smiling replied

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.410
she must then be very beautiful indeed

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.190
how happy you have been could not I see

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.760
her

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.990
ah dear Miss Charlotte do lend me your

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.940
yellow suit of clothes which you wear

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.730
every day I cried Miss Charlotte lend my

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.670
clothes to such a dirty cinderwench as

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.660
you I should be a fool Cinderella

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.260
indeed expected well such an answer and

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.320
was very glad of the refuse

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.530
for she would have been sadly put to if

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.510
her sister had lent her what she had

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.280
asked for jokingly the next day the two

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.070
sisters were at the ball and so was

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.850
Cinderella but dressed more

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.460
magnificently than before the king's son

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.700
was always by her and never ceased his

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.820
compliments and kind speeches to her to

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.130
whom all this was so far from being

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.460
tiresome that she quite forgot what her

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.220
godmother had recommended to her so that

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.120
she at last counted the clock striking

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.510
12:00 when she thought it to be no more

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.290
than eleven she then rose up and fled as

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.430
nimble as a deer the Prince followed but

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.190
could not overtake her she left behind

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.570
one of her glass slippers which the

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.290
Prince took up most carefully she got

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.500
home but quite out of breath and in her

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.160
nasty old clothes having nothing left of

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.490
all her finery but one of the little

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.050
slippers fellow too that she had dropped

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.060
the guards at the palace gate were asked

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.450
if they had not seen a princess go out

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.890
they replied that they had seen nobody

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.650
go out at a young girl very meanly

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.890
dressed and who had more the air of a

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.380
poor country wench than a gentlewoman

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.870
when the two sisters returned from the

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.780
ball Cinderella asked them if they had

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.300
been well entertained and if the fine

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.960
lady had been there they told her yes

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.660
but that she hurried away immediately

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.060
when it struck twelve and with so much

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.890
haste that she dropped one of her little

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.290
glass slippers the prettiest in the

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.260
world which the king's son had taken up

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.710
and that most certainly he was very much

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.290
in love with the beautiful person who

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.950
owned the glass slipper what they said

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.490
was very true for a few days after the

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.620
king's son commanded it to be proclaimed

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.010
by sound of trumpet that he would marry

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.540
the

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.720
young woman whose foot would perfectly

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.000
fit the slipper he sent out his most

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.250
trusted advisors from the palace who

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.340
began to try it upon the princesses then

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.940
the duchesses and all the court but in

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.480
vain it was brought to the two sisters

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.720
who each did all that she possibly could

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.380
to thrust her foot into the slipper but

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.670
neither sister could manage to do so

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.970
Cinderella who saw all this and knew her

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.100
slipper said to them laughing uh-huh

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.430
let me see if it will not fit me her

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.460
sisters burst out laughing and began to

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.880
tease her the gentlemen who were sent to

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.860
try the slipper looked earnestly at

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.800
Cinderella and finding her very handsome

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.470
said it was only right that she should

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.740
try and that he had orders to let every

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.970
girl try he asked Cinderella to sit down

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.400
and putting the slipper to her foot

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.890
he found it went on very easily and

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.570
fitted her as if it had been made of wax

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.910
the astonishment her two sisters were in

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.790
was excessively great but still

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.800
abundantly greater when Cinderella

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.410
pulled out of her pocket the other

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.460
slipper and put it on her foot thereupon

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.640
in came her godmother who having touched

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.570
with her wand

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.390
Cinderella's clothes made them richer

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.820
and more magnificent than any of those

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.780
she had seen before and now her two

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.650
sisters found her to be that fine

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.420
beautiful lady who may had seen at the

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.570
ball they threw themselves at her feet

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.030
to beg for pardon for all the ill

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.150
treatment they had dished out to her

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.550
Cinderella took them up and as she

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.920
embraced them cried that she forgave

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.770
them with all her heart and desired them

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.880
always to love her she was brought by

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.760
